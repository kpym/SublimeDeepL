# SublimeDeepL

A small plugin for Sublime Text 3 (and probably 2 as well) that adds two `deepl` commands. One to open [DeepL translate](https://www.deepl.com/translate), and one to open [DeepL rewrite](https://www.deepl.com/write) in the default browser, pre-filled with the current selection.

Commands:
- `DeepL: Translate selection` [<kbd>alt+t</kbd>]
- `DeepL: Rewrite selection` [<kbd>alt+shift+t</kbd>]
